				<h1>History</h1> 
				<p> Organized in the fall of 1994, HRAACF (Harvard Radcliffe Asian American Christian Fellowship) is the sister InterVarsity chapter of the Harvard-Radcliffe Christian Fellowship, which pioneered HRAACF in order to pursue its goals of engaging the Harvard campus and better understanding the value of multiethnicity. HRAACF offers Asian-specific support and cultural lenses to living out the Gospel. It strives to reach out to Asian Americans at Harvard and to develop leaders for the Asian American church.</p>  
				<p>In 2010 the Harvard College Black Christian Fellowship was organized out of HRCF for similar reasons. Now HRCF, HRAACF, HCBCF work under a covenant relationship that provides regular joint Large Group meetings, joint retreats, cooperative campus-wide evangelism events, and partnering staff teams. HRCF, HRAACF, HCBCF renew their convenant annually at their week-long retreat at the end of the year.</p>
